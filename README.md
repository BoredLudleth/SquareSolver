`main.cpp` Compiles all program

`SquareSolver.cpp` This file consists cunctions for input, solve and output—é

`SquareSolver.hpp` It's header-file for `SquareSolver.cpp`

`Tests.cpp` It's test-file

`Tests.hpp` It's header-file for `Tests.cpp`

`TEST.txt` This file uses for tests.

`Makefile` This uses for optimazing using terminal for user. Futhermore you can run tests.

### Makefile
